Create a new project named `router_example`, and populate it as described in
[Setup for Development](/angular/guide/setup).
For this first milestone, you'll create a rudimentary
version of the app that navigates between two (placeholder) views.

<div id="base-href"></div>
## Set the *base href*

The router uses the browser's
[history.pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries)
for navigation. Thanks to `pushState`, you can make in-app URLs indistinguishable from server URLs,
for example `localhost:3000/crisis-center`.

Modern HTML 5 browsers were the first to support `pushState` which is why many people refer to these URLs as
"HTML 5 style" URLs.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  HTML 5 style is the router default.
  See the Appendix on [LocationStrategy and browser URL styles](appendices#browser-url-styles) to
  learn why HTML 5 style is preferred, how to adjust its behavior, and how to switch to the
  older hash (#) style, when necessary.
</div>

You must add a [&lt;base href> element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base)
to the app's `index.html` for `pushState` routing to work.
The browser uses the base `href` value to prefix *relative* URLs when referencing
CSS files, scripts, and images.

The [starter app](/angular/tutorial/toh-pt0) sets the `<base>` element dynamically,
so that sample apps built from it can be **run and tested during development** using any
of the [**officially recommended tools**](/angular/guide/setup#running-the-app):

<?code-excerpt "web/index.html (base-href)" title?>
```
  <script>
    // WARNING: DO NOT set the <base href> like this in production!
    // Details: https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular/guide/router
    (function () {
      // App being served out of web folder (like WebStorm does)?
      var match = document.location.pathname.match(/^\/[-\w]+\/web\//);
      var href = match ? match[0] : '/';
      document.write('<base href="' + href + '" />');
    }());
  </script>
```

For a **production** build, **replace the `<script>`** with a
`<base>` element where the `href` is set to your application's root path.
If the path is empty, then use:

<?code-excerpt?>
```html
  <head>
    <base href="/">
    ...
  </head>
```

You can also statically set the `<base href>` during development.
When running `pub serve` from the command line, use `href="/"`.
When running apps from WebStorm, use <code>href="<em>my_project</em>/web/"</code>,
where <em>my_project</em> is the name of your project.

<?code-excerpt?>
```html
  <base href="/my_project/web/">
```

<div id="import"></div>
## Configure the routes for the Router

Begin by importing the router library.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component_1.dart (import)" title?>
```
  import 'package:angular2/router.dart';
```

The router is not part of the Angular core, it is in its own library.
The router is an optional service because not all applications
need routing and, depending on your requirements, you may need a different routing library.

You teach the router how to navigate by configuring it with routes.

<div id="route-config"></div>
## @RouteConfig

A router must be configured with a list of route definitions.
A router also needs a *host component*, a point of origin for its navigations.

The `@RouteConfig` annotation combines the creation of a new router, its configuration, and
its assignment to a host component in a single step.

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component_1.dart (routes)"?>
```
  @RouteConfig(const [
    const Route(
        path: '/crisis-center',
        name: 'CrisisCenter',
        component: CrisisCenterComponent),
    const Route(path: '/heroes', name: 'Heroes', component: HeroesComponent)
  ])
  class AppComponent {}
```

The `@RouteConfig()` is applied to `AppComponent` which makes it the router's host component.
The argument to `@RouteConfig()` is a list of *route definitions*.

Each definition is a [Route](/angular/api/angular.router/Route-class.html) which has a

- `path`: the URL path segment for this route
- `name`: the name of the route, which *must* be spelled in
   [PascalCase](../glossary.html#pascalcase)
   to avoid possible confusion with the route `path`
- `component`: the component associated with this route

The router draws upon its registry of definitions when the browser URL changes
or when application code tells the router to navigate along a route path.

In simpler terms, you might say this of the first route:

- When the browser's location URL changes to match the path segment `/crisis-center`, then
the router activates an instance of the `CrisisCenterComponent` and displays its view.

- When the application requests navigation to the route named `CrisisCenter`, then the router
activates an instance of `CrisisCenterComponent`, displays its view, and updates the
browser's address location and history with the URL for that path.

<div id="shell"></div>
## The *AppComponent* shell

`AppComponent` is the application shell. It has a title, a navigation bar with two links,
and a *router outlet* where the router swaps views on and off the page. Here's what you get:

<img class="image-display" src='/resources/images/devguide/router/shell-and-outlet.png' alt="Shell" width="332">

<div id="shell-template"></div>
The corresponding component template looks like this:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component_1.dart (template)"?>
```
  template: '''
    <h1>Angular Router</h1>
    <nav>
      <a [routerLink]="['CrisisCenter']">Crisis Center</a>
      <a [routerLink]="['Heroes']">Heroes</a>
    </nav>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  ''',
  styles: const ['.router-link-active {color: #039be5;}'],
```

<div id="router-outlet"></div>
## *RouterOutlet*

The `RouterOutlet` is a directive from the router library that marks
the spot in the template where the router should display the views for that outlet.

<div class="l-sub-section" markdown="1">
  The `<router-outlet>` element is rendered in the DOM.
  The router inserts the outlet's view elements as siblings
  immediately _after_ the `<router-outlet>`.
</div>

<div id="router-link"></div>
## *RouterLink* binding

Above the outlet, within the anchor tags, you see
[property bindings](../template-syntax.html#property-binding) to
`RouterLink` directives that look like `[routerLink]="[...]"`.
The template expression to the right of the equals is a
**[link parameters list](appendices#link-parameters-list)**, and it
holds the ingredients to router navigation:

- the name of the route that prescribes the destination component and a path for the URL
- optional route and query parameters that go into the route URL

The lists shown in the example above, each have a single parameter, a route name.
You'll see the use of route parameters later.

{% comment %}
//- TODO: once we've moved to the new router (supporting RouterLinkActive), make this its own section
//- and consider adding more material (cf. corresponding TS docs).
## *RouterLinkActive* binding
{% endcomment %}

The `RouterLink` directive adds the `router-link-active` CSS class to active router link.
This cascades down through each level of the route tree, so parent and child router links
can be active at the same time.

## Declaring router providers and directives

To use the router, you must add its services to your application. One
way to achieve this is by adding `ROUTER_PROVIDERS` to your shell
component's `providers` list.

To use router directives like `RouterLink` and `RouterOutlet` within a
component, you must add them to the component's `directives` list.

Here is the current state of `app_component.dart` which illustrates both of these additions:

<?code-excerpt "lib/app_component_1.dart" title?>
```
  import 'package:angular2/angular2.dart';
  import 'package:angular2/router.dart';

  import 'src/crisis_center_component_1.dart';
  import 'src/heroes_component_1.dart';

  @Component(
    selector: 'my-app',
    template: '''
      <h1>Angular Router</h1>
      <nav>
        <a [routerLink]="['CrisisCenter']">Crisis Center</a>
        <a [routerLink]="['Heroes']">Heroes</a>
      </nav>
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    ''',
    styles: const ['.router-link-active {color: #039be5;}'],
    directives: const [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES],
    providers: const [ROUTER_PROVIDERS],
  )
  @RouteConfig(const [
    const Route(
        path: '/crisis-center',
        name: 'CrisisCenter',
        component: CrisisCenterComponent),
    const Route(path: '/heroes', name: 'Heroes', component: HeroesComponent)
  ])
  class AppComponent {}
```

<div id="wrap-up"></div>
## Application code

You've got a very basic, navigating app, one that can switch between two views
when the user clicks a link.
The starter app's structure looks like this:

<div class="ul-filetree" markdown="1">
- router_example
  - lib
    - app_component.dart
    - src
      - crisis_center_component.dart
      - heroes.component.dart
  - web
    - index.html
    - main.dart
    - styles.css
</div>
