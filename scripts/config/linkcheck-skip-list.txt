# ANGULAR
# =======

# LINKS KNOWN TO BE VALID
# -----------------------

# API search parameter links
/angular/api/#!\?query=

# We don't serve the dartdoc generated index.html; so the anchor to libraries isn't valid
/angular/api/index(.html)?#libraries$

# KNOWN ISSUES (to be investigated and/or resolved soon)
# ------------

# Temporary as we transition to AngularDart 4 and docs under the doc repo folder:
/angular/api/go/angular-dart-docs/

# angular.io is now an Angular app; the link checker has difficulty seeing anchors
# (probably because the page hasn't been fully generated yet), so skip such links:
https://angular.io/[^#]*#

# Ignore warnings about missing anchors into the live example apps:
http://angular-examples.github.io/[^/]+/?#

# Sites using hash location strategy or anchors instead of query params.
# Hence linkcheck issues a warning about the missing "anchor". Silence these:
